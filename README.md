Tools for working with DNA sequences


dna.py takes any arbitrary DNA
 text sequence as text and converts it to a packed array of 8 bit integers.
 Each 8 bit integer is able to store 4 base pairs(A,C,T, or G).
 Whereas storing them as text requires 8 bits for only one base pair.

test.py shows usage and an example
